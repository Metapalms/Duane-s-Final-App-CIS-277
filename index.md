During times I would just get a random urge to create some random little applets in C++. Because why not? 

This "Final App" is just a culmination of a few of those apps. They have helped me bide my time at certain moments whether during a long car ride, or a lecture, or even while I worked fastlanes at Woodmans. However, they have also served at times as a getaway from an emotional rollercoaster. 

I figured why not turn this into my final app. and let some of you also enjoy what I have created.


### Two people can try

For this final I will be using [program without two player tic tac toe](https://repl.it/@Metapalms/Actual-Actual-C-276-Final)

This is without the two player tic tac toe. I want to leave the two player tictactoe game out bceause I had created it before this class as a sort of exercise for myself (well all these other ones are too I guess). However, I remember having a little bit of a guide and ther will be similiar code other places. I do not want called for plagerism, so I am leaving it out of the final I am doing for school. I feel like I can do the bot one because for the most part they are not the same program in my eyes. The output may look the same but I added so much to the interior

Never-the-less, if you would like the program [with two player tic tac toe](https://repl.it/@Metapalms/Not-Actual-C-276-Final-Wish). There is the link


## Audience

Since humans has moved form being hunters and gatherers to more agricultural societies we have had more pass time. That has aloud us to create the very complex and complicated civilizations which we live in today. However, even as busy, complex, and complicated, as our lives get there are always little bits of time where sometimes someone isn't doing something. 

These little quick nonsensical games are games that you can play no matter the age if you have a little time left to spare and just want to mess around for a little as I did while making them.



## Menu

Here you will simply be able to choose what game you would like to play.

I had programmed these apps seperatly and individually at first. However, finding out about headers I was able to combine them pretty easily and when you choose one option it will simply just send you over seemlessly. (At least I hope)


### 21 BlackJack

Definitly my pride and joy out of these bunch of programs. This was the one I started purely for the purpose for the final and the rest are just thrown in there because I thought why not and it would be cool.

I don't know why I had an urger to play and create 21 BlackJack, but I think it was because my friends were over and we wanted to play cards for some reason. I don't know how to play any other card game that well so we just decided a simple 21 BlackJack at first. I couldn't find the cards. So we played something else probably much better.

Never-the-less, here it is

First it will ask you how many players will be playing. I had set it between 1 and 4 simply because I didn't care to add much more, and don't see games over 4 that often. However, in the code I looked back and it wouldn't be that hard to add more players. Just needed to add another dimention to the double arrays and the rest are done with loops. 

Next, after I had created it I wanted to add a betting system, thus I did. So it will ask you the ammount you would like everyone to start with. You could put 0 here if you don't want to do betting. 

Then, it is simply just like normal BlackJack.

The rates I used came from the BlackJack world series in 2018 
- BlackJack 2.5 multiplier
- Win 2 miltiplier 
- Surrender .5 mitiplier


### CoinFlip

Just a simple coinflip game that I wanted to do before it was an assigment. I am not sure but I planned on putting it into the TicTacToe against a bot to decide who woudl go first. 



### TicTacToe w/ Bot 

!image (ticTacToe w/ bot)

This one I spent time on before focusing on the final and I found a lot of enjoyment out of it. Right now it is pretty good defencivly, however, I was not able to add complex moves in the end beacuse I started working on BlackJack which sort of bummbed me.
