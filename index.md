# Welcome to Arcade of Things GitHub Page

During times I would just get a random urge to create random little applets in C++. Because why not? 

This "Final App" is just a culmination of a few of those apps. They have helped me not only bid my time. Whether during a long car ride, or  but also served at times a getaway from an emotional rollercoaster. It is funny how most of these programs I had written on reciept paper while working on fast lanes at Woodman's. 

I figured why not turn this into my final app.
